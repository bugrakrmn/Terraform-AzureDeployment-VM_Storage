EXPLANATION OF FILES:

PROVIDER--> A provider in Terraform is a plugin that enables interaction with an API. This includes Cloud providers and Software-as-a-service providers. The providers are specified in the Terraform configuration code. They tell Terraform which services it needs to interact with.


RESOURCE_GROUP-->A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group

STORAGE-->Terraform Module to create an Azure storage account with a set of containers (and access level), set of file shares (and quota), tables, queues, Network policies and Blob lifecycle management.

VM-->Terraform enables the definition, preview, and deployment of cloud infrastructure. Using Terraform, you create configuration files using HCL syntax. The HCL syntax allows you to specify the cloud provider - such as Azure - and the elements that make up your cloud infrastructure.
